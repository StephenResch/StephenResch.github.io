                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>My name is [REDACTED] and I like to make jokes about everyone and everything, including myself. I'm generally a kind and thoughtful <br> person, and I will
                    remain that way unless someone gets on my nerves. I can also become anxious over very miniscule events, which <br> is something that
                    I'm working to fix. It's baffling that a simple pencil drop can rotate my smile 180 degress. It's even more baffling that you're <br>
                    still reading this, so don't overthink a random nobody trying to write an autobiography on their "About Me" page. This is one example <br>of my
                    silly personality taking over whatever I'm trying to do.

                <h2>Academics</h2>
                <p>At the time of typing this, I'm currently attending a tech school that shall not <br> be named for the sake of privacy. As an Honors 
                    student (enrolled in all Honors classes), <br> my work ethic involves putting as much effort into an assignment as possible. <br> However, 
                    my procrastination eventually takes control, causing me to sometimes <br> wait until the last minute to complete a task. Due to being in 
                    a club, I'm on <br> the list of Distinguished Honor Roll students in my school. I plan to further <br> improve my skills as I experience high 
                    school while working towards a scholarship for college. </p>
