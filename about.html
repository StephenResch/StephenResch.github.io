                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>My name is [REDACTED] and I like to make jokes about everyone and everything, including myself. I'm generally a kind and thoughtful <br> person, and I will
                    remain that way unless someone gets on my nerves. I can also become anxious over very miniscule events, which <br> is something that
                    I'm working to fix. It's baffling that a simple pencil drop can rotate my smile 180 degress. It's even more baffling that you're <br>
                    still reading this, so don't overthink a random nobody trying to write an autobiography on their "About Me" page. This is one example <br>of my
                    silly personality taking over whatever I'm trying to do.

                <h2>Academics</h2>
                <p>At the time of typing this, I'm currently attending a tech <br> school that shall not be named for the sake of privacy. As an <br> Honors 
                    student (enrolled in all Honors classes), my work ethic <br> involves putting as much effort into an assignment as possible. <br> However, 
                    my procrastination eventually takes control, causing me to sometimes wait until the last minute to complete a task. Due to being <br> in 
                    a club, I'm on the list of Distinguished Honor Roll students in my <br>school. I plan to further improve my skills as I experience high 
                    school <br> while working towards a scholarship for college. </p>

                <h2 style="display: block;">Activities</h2>
                <p>I do many things during my free time. This includes taking care of <br>
                my two cats and spending time with my family. My two cats are named <br>
                Dasher and Harley, and both of them are real goofballs. On special <br>
                occasions, my family with play games like air hockey, foosball, and <br>
                ping pong. One of my favorite activities is playing video games. The <br>
                games I'm currently playing are Helldivers 2, Monster Hunter Rise, and <br>
                Warframe. </p>
