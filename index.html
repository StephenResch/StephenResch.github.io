                <p>Thank you for visiting this site. To move around, left-click the links below <br>
                    the "Home Page" text. The "About Me" section covers my personality, <br>
                    academics, and activites I partake in. The "Get To School" section includes <br>
                    information about the game, some images depicting key features, and the link to play.
                    Finally, click "Toggle Arson" to deep fry the page like fish at Long John Silvers.</p>

                <h2 style="display: block;">Purpose</h2>
                <p>There are two main purposes for this website. The first is for having a <br>
                    place to put my game, because in its current state, it's size does not <br>
                    validate a spot on Steam, a PC gaming platform. The second reason for creating
                    this website is to keep followers of the game updated on whatever is going on.
                    This can include game updates, Q&A's and community polls.</p>

            <div class="post">
                <h2 style="display: block;">Small Q&A</h2>
                <b>Why is some of your information left out?</b>
                <p>Since this website is accessable to anyone, the information presented <br>
                    can be used
                    for good or bad. I censored a bit of it to <br>
                    keep my privacy intact.</p>
                <b>How often will Get To School be updated?</b>
                <p>The rate of updates will depend on my ability to come up with unique ideas. <br>
                    It will take longer if I make a large amount of changes to group together in one release.</p>
                <b>How can someone contact you?</b>
                <p>They could contact me through Gmail and social media when I set up the accounts.</p>
